Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    2
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           112 out of   7,168    1%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             1,876 out of   7,168   26%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,190 out of   3,584   33%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,190 out of   1,190 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,190   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       1,895 out of   7,168   26%
    Number used as logic:             1,876
    Number used as a route-thru:         19

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 22 out of     173   12%
  Number of MULT18X18s:                   4 out of      16   25%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     1 out of       8   12%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                4.10

Peak Memory Usage:  238 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  3 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   3 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Section 1 - Errors
------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Pack:249 - The following adjacent carry multiplexers occupy different
   slice components.  The resulting carry chain will have suboptimal timing.
   	x_note_length_counter/Mcompar_GND_6_o_GND_6_o_LessThan_8_o_cy<28>
   	x_note_length_counter/Mcount_note_length_partial_cy<0>
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator x_note_player/Mram__n218715861_181
   failed to merge with F5 multiplexer x_note_player/Mram__n21874721_17_f5_0. 
   There is a conflict for the FXMUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal
   timing.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.

* Slices can be packed with basic elements from multiple hierarchies.
  Therefore, a slice will be counted in every hierarchical module
  that each of its packed basic elements belong to.
** For each column, there are two numbers reported <A>/<B>.
   <A> is the number of elements that belong to that specific hierarchical module.
   <B> is the total number of elements from that hierarchical module and any lower level
   hierarchical modules below.
*** The LUTRAM column counts all LUTs used as memory including RAM, ROM, and shift registers.
